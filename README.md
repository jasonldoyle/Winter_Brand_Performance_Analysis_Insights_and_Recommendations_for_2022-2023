With a portfolio of niche brands catering to specific market needs, the company has a niche winter brand in their American market which they want to analysis to decided where to go in the future. I’m patterning with the Head of Operations to analyse the brand’s performance for the year 2023-2024 to extract insights and deliver recommendations to improve performance across sales, product, and marketing teams.

## Excecutive Summary

This report highlights key trends across customer demographics, purchasing behavior, and seasonal performance. The October-January period drives nearly 70% of annual revenue, fueled by a 412% sales surge in October. Seasonal campaigns proved highly effective, with promo code usage and subscriptions increasing by 963% and 596.7%, respectively. Engagement metrics, including likes, views, and purchases, also saw sharp increases during this time, aligning with campaign efforts. These trends emphasize the importance of focusing on targeted seasonal strategies and leveraging promotional campaigns to sustain momentum and maximize revenue.

# Recommendations
## Targeted Marketing for Key Demographics
* Engage Peak Age Group: Target age group 46-55 with personalised marketing campaigns, as they represent the largest and most engaged demographic.
* Appeal to Younger Shoppers: Capitalise on spending power of customers aged 18-25 by offering youth-oriented promotions and products to maximise their $60.65 average spending.

## Optimising Shipping and Checkout Behaviour
* Boost Holiday Shipping Offers: Expand free shipping offers during the winter peak season, the most active shipping period, to further boost holiday sales and improve reviews.
* Enhance Payment Experience: Improve checkout flow for PayPal and credit card payment options, which see slight increases among key age groups (46-65).
* Tailor Discounts to Habits: Focus on quarterly purchase incentives for customers aged 46-55 and annual discounts for 56-65 to match their buying habits.

## Maximising Sales Momentum
* Capitalize on Off-Season Spikes: Launch mid-year sales events and marketing campaigns leading up to and during June and July to leverage spikes among 18-25 (+73%) and 26-35 (+56%) age groups.
* Reduce Post-Holiday Sales Decline: Extend holiday campaigns into February to soften the 70% post-holiday sales drop.
* Focus on Peak Periods: Direct marketing and resources to the October-January period, which accounts for 70% of annual revenue, to maximise peak-season impact.

## Strategic Product Promotions
* Drive Clothing Sales: Prioritise clothing initiatives during peak season (October-December), as it dominates sales, with accessories as a secondary focus due to their 520% rise in October.
* Leverage Footwear in June: Promote footwear in June, leveraging its 58% off-season increase, to diversify revenue streams outside peak periods.
* Reevaluate Outerwear Investment: Reduce investment in outerwear, which underperforms compared to other categories, and focus on top sellers like jewellery and pants.

## Increasing Engagement Through Interactions
* Expand Social Media Campaigns: Increase social media campaign spending and customer interaction in October, where likes, views, and purchases surge by over 287%.
* Encourage Positive Reviews: Include incentives for positive reviews later in the peak season, as review counts increase by 512% in October but average ratings drop slightly (-1%) by December.
* Combat Post-Holiday Drop: Address post-holiday engagement decline with targeted campaigns to maintain momentum after January’s 65%-68% interaction drop.

## Retaining and Growing Subscriptions
* Leverage Seasonal Subscription Peaks: Focus on subscription campaigns in October-November, where activations spike by 596.7% and maintain strong performance.
* Offer Retention Incentives: Provide targeted offers at the start of the off-season (January-February) to mitigate the 80.3% drop in subscriptions.
* Build Subscription Momentum: Encourage consistent subscription growth during March-August through bundled offers and exclusive content to prepare for the October peak.

## Enhancing Promotion Campaign Performance
* Sustain Campaign Success: Extend the success of October campaigns into Q1 by emphasising promo code usage, which increased by 963%.
* Combat Stagnation Mid-Year: Run smaller-scale promotions during the mid-year (March-August) to address stagnation, where promo code usage averages only 30 transactions per month.
* Target Non-Promo Shoppers: Use collected customer data to target non-promo customers, ensuring promo codes remain a driver of additional purchases rather than cannibalising existing sales.
